# Plogging Universe

# Project Background

### Carbon Neutral
Taking steps to bring the chain’s footprint to zero

- low energy consumption
- supporting the projects for more climate positive
- studying the impact of Solana blockchain

Solana is building a better, more energy-efficient Web3,
climate-focused ecosystem

### Gamification
- High TPS: reached 50000 TPS in testnet = Good for achievement, reward
- High Daily Active Users, Transactions, Stablecoin Volume = Good for competition, relationship

Solana has reached the fourth stage of motivation in gamification, which provides users with fun and rewards.

- Many countries and companies are adopting eco-friendly elements, such as carbon neutrality and the development of eco-friendly products
- Users interested in the rewards are motivated to take actions to gain rewards
- Users who are environmentally conscious practice a healthy and eco-friendly lifestyle

For previous reasons and for these reasons,
we decided to devolop the 'Ploverse' platform in Solana

# Problem & Solution

Exercise trackers can monitor indicators during workouts, such as consumed calories.
But they fail to provide enough rewards when users reached a goal.

Plogging contributes to the reduction of environmental pollution, but frequently, the photographic evidence goes unnoticed. This underscores the necessity for increased motivation to inspire a greater number of individuals to initiate and maintain plogging activities. 
Furthermore, given that plogging demands ongoing effort, user motivation might diminish if the rewards are inadequate. Therefore, we have integrated an NFT system with plogging to address these issues.

So we combined plogging with an NFT system. More solution is in the next page.

### Rewards
When users upload a plogging photo, a unique NFT token is generated based on that photo. 
This official certification of a user's plogging experience, along with the associated rewards, adds an element of fun and motivation, making plogging feel like a game.

### Sustainability
Every time a user contributes to environmental protection, whether through the amount of trash collected or their consistent participation, their NFT reflects their level of contribution. The clear goals and rewards associated with plogging enhance goal awareness and personal fulfillment.

### Life-friendly
Plogging promotes a healthy and eco-friendly lifestyle that can be practiced anywhere and at any time, even while traveling. Additionally, it allows for aerobic and easy exercises during the plogging activity.

### Incentives
NFTs earned through plogging have inherent value. Users can benefit from transactions with other users and have the option to donate their NFTs to environmental protection projects.

# Key Features

### Create Plocka NFT

We generate unique NFTs by analyzing the dominant colors in photos uploaded by users and arranging them in a specific order to create a visual design. These designs draw inspiration from the natural environment and incorporate elements of nature, such as plants and wildlife.

The process of transforming plogging certification photos into NFTs inspired by the natural environment symbolizes the positive impact of collecting litter during plogging on the beauty of the natural surroundings.
Plogging certification photos typically capture images of trash and waste, which might discourage users from sharing them on their social media profiles. However, by transforming these images into visually appealing designs, users can still validate and showcase their plogging efforts on social platforms with aesthetically pleasing content.

### Plocka Gallery

You can display your Plocka NFTs in your gallery, which allows you to gather not only your personal Plocka NFTs but also those created by other individuals. 
Additionally, you can easily share and post your NFTs on social media.

Moreover, you will have the capability to both purchase and sell these NFTs. This creates a community of people who certify their plogging achievements and can connect to exchange information about their plogging experiences.
We have plans to implement a feature on this page that will allow users to gather their own Plocka NFTs, as well as NFTs created by others. Furthermore, users will have the capability to both buy and sell these NFTs.

# Buisiness Model

### Target Customers
Individuals interested in the environment and exercise (walking, jogging).

### Key Values

- **Sustainability**
  : Environmental Awareness Campaign and Fitness Trends → Heightened awareness of eco-friendliness influences other behaviors.
- **Competitive**
  : Addresses both the eco and fitness markets. Offers flexibility by facilitating not only in-app user consumption but also intermediation between users and other apps.
- **Users**
  : Empowers users to be agents of eco-friendly actions, bringing them closer to environmental protection and improvement.
 For user sustainability, issues NFTs upon achieving specific goals (Solana transactions have a low environmental impact).
- **Advertising** (Advertisers, Sponsors)
  : NFT web3 ads, various tour advertisements. User clicks to navigate to the advertiser's page after viewing an ad.
- **Mediation**
  : Connected with exercise or environmental-related newsletters,  fees within the community.

# Roadmap

### Demo
The demo version we've developed so far is accessible through the following link, and it's currently optimized for PC screens.
- https://ploverse.vercel.app/

### Prototype
We intend to present the prototype with the following additional features:

- **Plocka Gallery Page** : We are planning to introduce a feature on this page that will enable users to collect their own Plocka NFTs, as well as NFTs created by others. Additionally, users will have the ability to both purchase and sell these NFTs.
- **Adding Designs** : In the current demo version, only a simple flower illustration is available. However, in future updates, we are planning to incorporate a variety of exquisite designs. This way, users' plogging certification photos can be transformed into even more aesthetically pleasing NFTs.

### Release
- Add community
- Provide customized service
